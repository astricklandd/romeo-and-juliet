## User Story (ðŸ‘•XL)

**As A** user (to ANY type of interface that YOU identify...buncha examples provided)  

**I want** an improved interface

**So that** I click fewer times

## Narrative

- There's a lot of bad design out there. Most of the time it really doesn't matter...sure it took me 0.2 extra seconds to buy something online or submit a form. This isn't a big deal, or is it? I bet we can fix it!
- You will need to find some user input: an app, a website, a kiosk, a TV/game console input, a microwave, or whatever. Something that is a bit lacking and can be improved. 
- Set up a REPO and DEPLOY a web-based app (just a page or pages) that 
- (a) shows off the inefficient user interace and explains it
- (b) and presents a prototype to fix it

## An Example? Sure
- Note: this is not _your_ exact assignment; some things have changed. Use as an example, borrow some code, but not a good idea to start from a clone of this one. 
- [old class example](https://laurencoggin.github.io/FinalProject/index.html)

## Min. Acceptance Criteria
- APP. Your Webpage(s) 
  - Deployed on GitHub Pages
  - Self-describing: has a header, title, description to tell us that you are presenting an improved user interface design for a particular problem
  - Can Navigate around and always get back, e.g, can click on prototype and then back to the "home" page (or tab or section)
  - links to REPO, Nu. (open in new tab, labelled) 
  - Clean & presentable 
  - "Sample" form output is presented somehow (like in my [Tumbly example](https://codepen.io/barrycumbie/pen/pWXWzz) or the other example I provided...but in a clean way and not like in that "dummy console" 
- REPO
  - REPO, File & Directory Naming: pascalCase & all file extensions in lowercase. 
  - Proper use of subidiretories (all images in an `img/` folder, all scripts in a `scripts` one, styles in a `css`, etc.)
  - links to your APP  
- CODE
  - Utilizes and correctly utilizes of Normalize, BS5, jQuery libraries
  - Code formatted correctly (DuckDuckGo it...vs code with "pretty" it up automatically) 
  - Uses event listeners and not inline function calls
  - Uses external script, style and not internal or inline
  - Logical code: can follow, understand, comments when needed
  - Nu Errors corrected. (Some weird ones are okay, but fix the easy ones)
